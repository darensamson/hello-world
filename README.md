# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.  It is a basic Hello World first attempt
Why am I digging into GitHub?  I am looking to expand my programming skills, find a project that I can contribute to and pickup a few new languages along the way.  I am hopeful to join a growing community and help others as they join and begin their programming journey.
